# ============================================
# NOTES:
# ============================================
# 1. Monitoring works WITHOUT Sentry DSN - just logs to console
# 2. With Sentry DSN, you get remote error tracking and alerting
# 3. Replace the DSN with your project's DSN from Sentry dashboard
# 4. Update VITE_ENVIRONMENT for each deployment environment
# 5. Update VITE_APP_VERSION when releasing new versions
