## 🎯 DECISION TREE

```
START: Where are you now?

├─ I have 8 hours/day
│  ├─ High risk tolerance
│  │  └─→ 2-week aggressive plan (minimal testing)
│  │
│  ├─ Medium risk tolerance
│  │  └─→ 3-week realistic plan (recommended)
│  │
│  └─ Low risk tolerance
│     └─→ 4-week conservative plan (thorough testing)
│
├─ I have 4 hours/day
│  └─→ 6-8 week part-time plan
│
└─ I can hire help
   ├─ 1 developer
   │  └─→ 3-4 week plan
   │
   └─ Team of 2-3
      └─→ 2-week accelerated plan
```

---

## 📈 RISK MITIGATION

### Week 1 Risks
```
Risk: Testing takes longer than expected
├─ Mitigation: Start with critical paths only
├─ Contingency: Extend to Day 6-7
└─ Impact: Low (can catch up in Week 2)

Risk: RLS policies don't work as expected
├─ Mitigation: Test thoroughly with sample data
├─ Contingency: Have fallback plan (app-level filtering)
└─ Impact: Medium (could delay pilot)
```

### Week 2-3 Risks
```
Risk: Pilot client discovers major bugs
├─ Mitigation: Thorough testing before launch
├─ Contingency: Have support on standby
└─ Impact: Medium (could need extra fix time)

Risk: Scope creep from client feedback
├─ Mitigation: Clear MVP scope, parking lot for future
├─ Contingency: Prioritize ruthlessly
└─ Impact: Low if managed well
```
