## 📞 For Your Investor

### Key Talking Points

**"How much time?"**
> "2-4 weeks to fully enterprise-ready, not 6 months. Gaps are specific: multi-tenancy, testing, monitoring."

**"How much money?"**
> "Investment should fund sales team, marketing, customer success—NOT core product development. The product is essentially done."

**"When can we start selling?"**

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

### ❌ WRONG: "It'll take 6 months"
**✅ RIGHT:** 2-4 weeks for critical items, not 6 months

### ❌ WRONG: "We need to rebuild the product"
**✅ RIGHT:** We need to add operational tooling (multi-tenancy, testing)

### ❌ WRONG: "The product isn't ready"
**✅ RIGHT:** The product IS ready (85-90%). We're hardening, not building.

### ❌ WRONG: "We need more developers"
**✅ RIGHT:** We need sales/marketing investment, not more engineering

### ❌ WRONG: "Can I get this done in a week?"
**✅ RIGHT:** Technically possible but risky. 2-3 weeks is realistic and safe.
